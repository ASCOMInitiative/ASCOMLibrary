The libraries in these folders are compiled native libraries, which means they must be prepared on their target systems and copied here.
The SOFA component uses the library name "libsofa", which means that all native libraries must be named "libsofa" (MacOS), "libsofa.so" (Linux variants) or "libsofa.dll" (Windows).
