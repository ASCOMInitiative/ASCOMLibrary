					NOVAS: Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Subroutines
				</h2>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					This component is a .NET presentation of the subroutines and function in the US Naval Observatory
					NOVAS 3.1 library. The following is extracted from its accompanying pdf document, which is also included
					in the ASCOM distribution
				</p>
				<p>
					The Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software (NOVAS) is a source-code library in Fortran, C, and Python that provides common astrometric quantities and transformations.
					It can supply, in one or two function calls, the instantaneous celestial position of any star or planet in a variety of coordinate systems.
					The library also provides access to all of the “building blocks” that go into such computations—single-purpose functions for common astrometric algorithms, such as those for precession, nutation, aberration,
					parallax, etc. NOVAS calculations are accurate at the sub-milliarcsecond level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The NOVAS algorithms are based on a vector and matrix formulation that is rigorous and consistent with recent recommendations of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
					Objects inside and outside the solar system are treated similarly. The position vectors formed and operated on by the NOVAS functions are defined within either the Barycentric Celestial Reference
					System (BCRS) or the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS), as appropriate. Both of these systems are described in IAU resolutions passed in 2000. GCRS quantities are converted to more
					familiar coordinate systems, such as the equator and equinox of date, by applying standard rotations.
